## Introduction

In this repo, you will find assembly instructions for the [PocketAdmin](https://github.com/krakrukra/PocketAdmin) project, courtesy of @krakrukra. **I did not create the hardware, nor the software! All credits go to the original creators of the PocketAdmin project!** The goal for this repo is, to provide a streamlined building process for a kit with all the parts pre-selected, so you can do it on your own, or more specificaly: So you can use this guide in a workshop I am planing to hold.
If you have already some experiences with assembling pcbs with smd parts, you propably won't need this guide.

**This workshop is inteded to create an educational device, please be carefull with what you do with your PocketAdmin.**

## Assembly

### Preparation

First, start by placing all the parts before you.
You should have:

1x STM32F072C8T6

1x W25N01GVZEIG flash memory
![](/doc/Images/Picture_Flash.png)

1x IP4220CZ6 transient protection diode

1x MCP1700-3302E/TT linear regulator

3x 10ÂµF capacitors

2x 18pF capacitors

7x 100nF capacitors

2x 33 ohm resistors

2x 4.7k ohm resistors

1x GREEN LED

1x NX5032GA 8MHz quartz crystal

1x TL3342 tactile switch 
![](/doc/Images/Picture_switch.png)

1x USB type A plug
![](/doc/Images/Picture_usb.png)

In summary you should have 12 different packages, 1 PCB and 1 Case.


### Assembly

Download and open the included [IBOM HTML file](/doc/BOM/ibom.html). Select the back-side of the PCB.  
Then apply soldering paste with the stencil. 
If have no expereince on how to that, wait for a trainer to help you.

Now, start placing the different parts onto the pcb.
Be careful to place the STM correctly.

When you are done, place the PCB in a reflow oven and wait until the first side is done.

When the PCB is baked, wait for it to cool down, then continue with the other side.
**WARNING: Do NOT place the USB-Header for the second reflow process. You will need to solder it by yourself!**

When the second side is also soldered, put on the USB-plug and solder the 4 pins by hand.

Check the PCB for short circuts or errors. If you find some and need help with correcting the errors, ask a trainer to help you.

You are now done with the assembly. Continue with the programming part.


## Programming

Start by cloning the PocketAdmin repository:
https://github.com/krakrukra/PocketAdmin

Then install the **dfu-utils** package for you operating system.

Then, insert a pair of tweezers into the boot0 and the 3.3v holes on the lower end of the pcb. They are located adjecent to the square hole.

Then insert the PocketAdmin into your USB Port. You can then remove the tweezers.
Make sure the STM is detected by running  
**dfu-util -l**

Open a terminal and navigate to the /firmware directory of the PocketAdmin repo.
Then flash the .dfu file with   
**dfu-util -a 0 -D firmware_13006.dfu**  
(The filename might change with newer versions.)

The terminal output should show you a progress bar. When finished, remove and reinsert the flash drive.
Your operating system should now be able to detect an unformated partition on an unkown device.
Create a partition table and format the drive in FAT32. (For example with gparted.)

## What now?

After flashing and creating a partition, you should be able to use your PocketAdmin.  
For a complete list of the capabilities, check the PocketAdmin [Wiki](https://github.com/krakrukra/PocketAdmin/wiki).

As a quick-start guide, try the following:
- Remove the PocketAdmin
- Hold down the button and insert it. Wait for about 1 second bevore you let the button go.
- Now your operating system should detect the PocketAdmin as a flash drive.
- Copy the "payload.txt" file from the /files directory onto the PocketAdmin.
- - Open any text editor. Then remove and reinsert the PocketAdmin. It should write something like "ABCDEFG..." etc...
